# Notify-me: Intelligent Notification System

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

**Notify-me** is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) for an intelligent notification system designed for a social web platform catering to the Architecture Industry. Its core mission is to enhance user engagement by delivering timely and relevant notifications about activities from their network (people they follow, new followers) and organically discovered content.

Built with a focus on simplicity for a bootstrapped startup (targeting 100 Daily Active Users), Notify-me integrates a rule-based "AI" to prioritize and personalize notifications, laying the groundwork for future scalability to millions of users.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Event-Driven Notifications:** Triggers notifications based on various user activities.

* **Intelligent Notification Logic (POC AI):**

    * Notifies users about new posts from people they follow.

    * Alerts users when they gain a new follower.

    * Informs content creators when their content is liked.

    * Includes logic to update follower/following relationships.

* **User & Content Management:** Basic models to manage users, content (blogs, chats, jobs), and their relationships.

* **Notification Management:** Stores, retrieves, and updates the read status of notifications.

* **Scalability Considerations:** Designed with an eye towards future growth, acknowledging the need for message queues and horizontal scaling for high DAU counts.

* **Clean Architecture:** Separated frontend and backend for maintainability and independent scaling.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
* Robust AI/ML: Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for personalized notification relevance, content recommendations, and anomaly detection.

* Real-time Notifications: Integrate WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant notification delivery without polling.

* User Authentication & Profiles: Implement a full authentication system (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and comprehensive user profiles.

* Notification Preferences: Allow users to customize which types of notifications they receive and through which channels (in-app, email, push).

* Caching Layer: Introduce Redis or similar caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce database load.

* Comprehensive Activity Types: Expand the system to handle a wider range of user activities within the platform.
